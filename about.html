        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          We are an indie rock band called Forever King Clark! Our members hail from different corners 
          of Monmouth County New Jersey, but we like to think of ourselves as an Asbury Park 
          band since we all met and continue to play predominantly 
          in the AP scene. Our lineup includes leader singer-songwriter and guitar player Bobby Kallok,
          John Michael on backup vocals and drums, and Amy Evans on bass. As a band we believe in doing as much as possible ourselves or with locals from our area. That's why we have forgone the cookie website and built something ourselves.
          <br>
          <br>
          2024 was a busy year for us playing shows in Asbury Park, Brooklyn, and the rest of the 
          shore while also releasing our first three singles. Also during that time we participated in several events 
          for local music labels including contributing a song to Shore Point's Record's "Local Summer" comp and performing at Telegraph Hill Record's 
          What A Wonderful Year music fest. This year we also made our first radio appearance as we performed at WMCX's The X Fest.
          <br><br>
          Going forward into 2025 we have a number of irons in the fire including the release of our debut EP(s?) and more shows in new cities. So be on the lookout for plenty of announcements coming soon!
          
          <br><br>Wondering what we sound like?  Some of our influences include Mac DeMarco, Weezer,
          and the Beatles as well as countless other surf rock, indie rock, and garage rock bands from the 60s to present day.
          We like to think of our music as an effort that combines the songwriting aspects of early classic rock with some of the aesthetics of current indie.
          <br>
          <br>
          P.S. You might want to know - why are we called Forever King Clark? Well, it's because of a dream Bobby had in college. Or maybe its John Michael's dog's nickname. Or maybe its the name of an old DOS game that tried to clone King's Quest 5.
          We're trying to keep it a little bit of a mystery!
