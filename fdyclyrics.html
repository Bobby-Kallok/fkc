         The Weird Song
        </h3>
        <p>
          Time to time i tend to worry<br>
About why you stick around<br>
Since I don’t see anything in myself<br>
Maybe you linger just cause you’re weird<br>

Just cause you’re weird<br>
<br>
<strong>
But if thats true then I don’t mind<br>
But if thats true then I don’t mind<br>
<br></strong>

You’d get better conversations<br>
With the tile between my feet<br>
But if you’re really looking downward<br>
Then maybe we’re in the same seat<br>


In the same seat <br>
<br>
<strong>
But if thats true then I don’t mind<br>
But if thats true then I don’t mind<br>
          </strong>
<br>
How can you stand me much longer<br>
When even I don’t like me<br>
Im open to changing my mind<br>
I guess we’ll just have to see<br>


Just have to see<br>
<br>
<strong>
But if thats true then I don’t mind<br>
But if thats true then I don’t mind<br>
But if thats true then I don’t mind<br>
But if thats true then I don’t mind<br>

         Summer's Gone
        </h3>
        <p>
          You think that its too late<br>
Spending time just to hesitate<br>
Convinced you can’t do anymore<br>
There’s still some time before<br>

<br>
          <strong>
Its gone summer’s gone<br>
Its gone summer’s gone<br>
Its gone summer’s gone<br>
Its gone summer’s gone<br>
          </strong>
<br>

I’ve seen you talk for hours<br>
Don’t tell me that it don’t matter<br>
Pull yourself up just this once<br>
August is such a quick month<br>
<br>
<strong>
Before its gone summer’s gone<br>
Its gone summer’s gone<br>
Its gone summer’s gone<br>
Its gone summer’s gone<br>

         Tired and Wired
        </h3>
        <p>
          You've been here before another night you've come up short<br>
The times you’ve done this you’d count them up but your thoughts drift<br>
To the little mistakes adding up, worse when you wake<br>

<br>
          <strong>
Your getting tired but still so wired once again<br>
Just treading water minds drifting farther always spent<br>
          </strong>
<br>

The epitomes you let slip ,the missed calls from home<br>
Last conversation you had with her in your imagination<br>
You could patch things up with just three words that be enough<br>
<br>
<strong>
Your getting tired but still so wired once again<br>
Just treading water minds drifting farther always spent’<br>
<br>

Your getting tired but still so wired once again<br>
Just treading water minds drifting farther always spent’<br>

         Sitting Out On The Patio
        </h3>
        <p>
          She said you might know them<br>
Well i guess that was another lie<br>
Sitting out on the patio<br>
You wonder why you even try<br>

<br>
          <strong>
You don’t need to stay out by yourself<br>
You don’t need to stay out by yourself<br>
          </strong>
<br>
Self imposed party exile<br>
Watching the embers give up their glow<br>
You could be anywhere else<br>
With people that you really know<br>

<br>
          <strong>
You don’t need to stay out by yourself<br>
You don’t need to stay out by yourself<br>
<br>
You don’t need to stay out by yourself<br>
You don’t need to stay out by yourself<br>
You don’t need to stay out by yourself<br>
You don’t need to stay out by yourself<br>
