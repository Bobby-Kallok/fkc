        <h2>Vacation</h2>
        <p>
          I’m done with the monotony<br />
          Of alway having to be<br />
          Don’t get me wrong this isn't the end<br />
          Just like to step out for a weekend<br />
          <br />

       <strong>   I need a vacation<br />
          I need a vacation from myself<br /></strong>

          <br />
          From myself<br />
          From myself<br />
          From myself<br />
          From myself<br />
          <br />

          My paranoid dreams fresh in bloom<br />
          The most hated one in the room<br />
          Thinking it through it can’t be true<br />
          But I can’t be sure unless I’m you<br />
          <br />

         <strong> I need a vacation<br />
          I need a vacation<br />
          I need a vacation from myself<br />
          <br /></strong>

          From myself<br />
          From myself<br />
          From myself<br />
          From myself<br />

          Missed you at the party<br />
          Wait I wasn't there<br />
          Such a shame to remember<br />
          How you really don't care<br />

          Did I lose the invite<br />
          Vanished into thin air<br />
          Like all your other reminders<br />
          And unanswered prayers<br />

          Last night at the show<br />

          Another lost evening<br />

          When we used to be friends<br />
          I saw you all the time<br />

        <h2>Us (This part isn't a song )</h2>
        <p>
          (Forever) King Clark is an indie rock band named
          after a book found in a dream by singer-songwriter
          Bobby Kallok. Originally a solo project started in
          2019 (Forever) King Clark has since expanded into a full band. Bobby
          is joined by Amy Evans on bass,
          John Michael on drums,
          Rob Deselich on guitar, and Dan Baumgarten on keys. The band's sound is
          influenced by classic and modern rock acts such as
          The Beatles, Mac DeMarco,
           Weezer, and Real Estate. We hope
          to see you soon!
