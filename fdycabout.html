        <h2>About the Five Dollar Yacht Club</h2>
        <p>
        The idea of the Five Dollar Yacht Club started like so many others, misunderstanding. One fall afternoon while raking leaves Bobby remarked to his brother that their folded up pile of leaves could be the "hotdog of the month". His brother misheard him and responded with those immortal words "Five Dollar Yacht Club".
       <br>
          <br>
          Immediately after hearing those words Bobby knew that this concept would need to be the basis of the first Forever King Clark EP. After spending years meandering through the 
          Jersey Shore music scene with only fleeting traces of belonging Bobby sought to create a club that would
          let everyone in. The feelings of alientaion, social ineptitude, and eventual acceptance are what fueled the semi-fictitous Five Dollar Yacht Club and the EP itself.

          As far as the rules of the Five Dollar Yacht Club are concerned it is quite simple. You pay five dollars and you're a member. Membership has a number of 
          perks including a membership card, five dollar yacht, access to the 
          website, and a five dollar discount on the Five Dollar Yacht Club EP(regularly priced at $15 and includes membership). Additonally membership entitles access to the numerous FDYC events occuring such as the various boat launches and regatta.

          <br>
          We hope to see you there!
